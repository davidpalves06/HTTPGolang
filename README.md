# WebSocket
Go Web Socket implementation as defined in protocol RFC 6455.

//TODO: Implement HTTP Library
Phase 2: HTTP Parsing and Handling
    HTTP Request Parsing:
        Learn the HTTP request format:
            Request Line: Method, URI, HTTP Version.
            Headers: Key-value pairs, ending with a blank line.
            Body (if present): Content after the headers for POST/PUT requests.
        Implement parsing logic to read the incoming data and split it into these components.

    Implement HTTP Methods:
        Start with basic methods like GET and HEAD:
            GET: Serve static content or handle simple dynamic content.
            HEAD: Similar to GET but only return headers.
        For POST or PUT, you'll need to handle request bodies.
    Response Generation:
        Understand HTTP response structure:
            Status Line: HTTP version, status code, reason phrase.
            Headers: Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.
            Body: The actual content or data.
        Implement functions to generate these responses based on the request.


Phase 3: Adding HTTP Features

    Error Handling:
        Implement responses for common HTTP status codes (404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.).
    Content Serving:
        Serve static files from the filesystem.
        Implement a basic way to handle dynamic content, perhaps through a simple CGI mechanism or templating.
    Basic Security:
        Implement headers like Server, Date, Content-Type.
        Add support for Connection: close or Keep-Alive headers for managing connections.


Phase 4: Enhancements and Refinement

    Connection Management:
        Handle persistent connections (Keep-Alive) if not already implemented.
    Concurrency:
        Use threading, forking, or asynchronous I/O to handle multiple connections simultaneously.
    Logging:
        Add logging of requests and responses for debugging and analytics.
    Error Handling and Testing:
        Implement robust error handling.
        Write tests to ensure your server responds correctly to various HTTP requests.
    HTTP/1.1 Features:
        Implement chunked transfer encoding if dealing with large responses.
        Support for conditional requests (If-Modified-Since, ETag).


Phase 5: Advanced Features

    Security Enhancements:
        Implement basic authentication.
        Consider HTTPS support (this would involve setting up SSL/TLS).
    Performance Tuning:
        Optimize for speed, perhaps by caching frequently accessed content or using efficient data structures for routing.
